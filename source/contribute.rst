Provide Code
============

Here we just give a very brief overview of how to contribute to SunPy.
If you are interested in contributing fixes, code or documentation to SunPy please checkout our :doc:`newcomers guide <./newcomers>`.
We also have a more in-depth `developer guide`_.

SunPy uses a distributed version control system called `Git`_ and the code is hosted on `GitHub`_.
To get started create an account `on github`_ and fork SunPy then submit your changes via a pull request.
If you are unfamiliar with `Git`_ and `GitHub <http://github.com>`__ our developer documentation provides a sample `workflow`_ but you can also find lots of `tutorials`_ online.
Please read up on our `Coding Standards`_ before getting started.
You can browse our `issue list`_ or our `wishlist`_ to find something that you can tackle.
Please send a quick email to the dev list or stop by the chat room to let people know what you are planning on working on (see the `Help`_ section).

SunPy Enhancement Proposals (SEP)
=================================

If you have an idea for a major enhancement or a proposed change to SunPy please consider submitting an SEP.
This process is modeled after the `Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)`_ and provides a structured proposal for the SunPy community to evaluate your idea.
You can find the `template`_ and `more information`_ about SEPs in the appropriate `SunPy repository`_. SEPs are submitted as pull requests into that repository.
