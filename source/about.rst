   		<h4>SunPy is a free and open-source software library for solar physics based on Python.</h4>
     	<p class="content">
	        SunPy is a community-developed free and open-source software package for solar physics. SunPy is meant to be a free alternative to the 
	        <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/">SolarSoft</a> 
	        data analysis environment which is based on the 
	        <a href="http://harrisgeospatial.com/ProductsandTechnology/Software/IDL.aspx">IDL</a> 
	        scientific programming language sold by Exelis. Though SolarSoft is open-source, IDL is not and can be prohibitively expensive. The aim of the SunPy project is to provide the software tools necessary so that anyone can analyze solar data. SunPy is written using the 
	        <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python programming language</a> 
	        and is build upon the scientific Python environment which includes the core packages 
	        <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, 
	        <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>. 
	        The development of SunPy is associated with that of 
	        <a href="http://www.astropy.org/">Astropy</a>. 
	        SunPy was founded on March 28, 2011 by a small group of scientists and developers at the 
	        <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a>. 
	        Thanks to the generous support of the ESA Summer of Code and the Google Summer of Code as well as contributors from around the world, SunPy is now a global project and is not associated with any individual institution.

The Team
========

   		<h4>SunPy is a living code base with many contributors. Anyone can and is welcome to get involved.</h4>
      	<p class="content">
	      SunPy (the project) is run by the SunPy organization. This organization was founded and defined by 
	      <a href="https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0002.md">this document</a>. 
	      Its primary goal is to facilitate and promote the use and development of a community-led, free and open-source solar data-analysis software based on the scientific Python environment. The organization consists of a lead developer, a board of directors, and the developer community. The purpose of the board is to lead the overal structure and direction of SunPy while the lead developer works with the developer community to implement it.

SunPy vs SolarSoft
==================

      	<h4>SunPy is a living code base with many contributors. Anyone can and is welcome to get involved.</h4>
      	<p class="content">
      	  The IDL-based SolarSoft analysis environment is a mature and rich code base to do Solar physics. Unfortunately not every person or institution have the capital necessary to fund a yearly IDL license. With the rise of scientific computing in Python new tools are now available to make developing the basics of a solar data analysis environment straightforward.

      <h4>If you have used SunPy in your scientific work we would appreciate it if you would acknowledge it.</h4>
      <p class="content">
        The continued growth and development of SunPy is dependent on the community being aware of the use SunPy. If you use SunPy, we therefore ask that you acknowledge SunPy appropriately in a publication or presentation (poster or talk).
		<ul>
        	<li>
        		<b>For a publication</b>, we recommend the following line be added to the conclusion or acknowledgements
