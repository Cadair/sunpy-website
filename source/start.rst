SunPy needs you
===============

Welcome! If you came across this page, you just might be new to SunPy!

| SunPy aims to be a comprehensive Python package that allows solar
  physicists to deep dive in the vast amount of solar data available.
| The people who help develop or contribute to SunPy are varied in
  ability and experience with the vast majority being volunteers who
  dedicate time each week.
| We pride ourselves on being a welcoming community and we would love to
  have you become a part of this!

If you have any questions, comments or just want to say hello, we have
online chat `here`_ which requires no registration or a bit more old
school, a `Google Group`_ which you can email.

How To Contribute
-----------------

Not Code
~~~~~~~~

| Since SunPy is the work of many volunteers, we are always looking for
  more people to contribute however they can.
| A common misconception (which applies to any package) is that all we
  really want is some Python code, we do not only require code
  contributions!
| If you do not have the time or the desire to code, we have lots of
  areas where we can use help.

| Most of the items within SunPy has been documented and is hosted
  online `here <http://docs.sunpy.org/en/latest/index.html>`__.
| This documentation is not only for the code itself but contains setup
  instructions, quick start guides and worked examples.
| However, documentation is never complete; there are always areas that
  could be expanded upon or could do with some proof reading to check
  whether what is written is easy to follow and understandable.
| **(Must be more non-code stuff)**

Code
~~~~

| If you would prefer to code Python instead, we have a SunPy issue list
  on `Github`_ where all the known issues with SunPy are kept.
| Each issue can have a label and the `Package Novice label`_ is a good
  place to start.
| These are issues that have been deemed a good way to be eased into
  SunPy and are achievable with little understanding of the SunPy
  codebase.

| If you came here from the Mozilla Sprint, we have a `mozsprint
  label.`_
| These issues are similar in nature to the Package Novice label but
  with a slight difference that these issues are (we think) achievable
  within the timescale of the sprint.

How to setup a work environment
-------------------------------

| We recommend using miniconda or Anaconda instead of your native
  operating system Python packages as it makes installing SunPy easier
  but also debugging.
| If you have never setup a conda environment before, here is a very
  quick guide to getting setup.

| The first step is to install the `miniconda`_ version that corresponds
  to your operating system.
| Once you have downloaded the miniconda version you need, you can run
  the download.
| If you get stuck, the i
